\noindent
The work presented here, performed during the autumn of 1986, is my
M.~Sc.\@ Thesis in Computer Science. Throughout this period D.~Ph.\@ Kim G.~Larsen has been my supervisor.

As presented, the work is intended for fellow students and other people interested
in construction, verification, and implementation of automatic tools aiding verification of (CCS-)processes.

Figures, theorems, definitions etc.\@ are numbered sequentially within each section (e.g.\@ theorem 3.1.2 is theorem two of section one in chapter three).

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgements}
First of all I would like to thank my supervisor D.~Ph.\@ Kim G.~Larsen for his invaluable guidance, his constant encouragement, and enthusiasm throughout this period.

I would also like to thank my family and friends for being helpful, supporting, and understanding during my time of studies. It would certainly not have been possible without you.

A special word of gratitude is directed towards Henrik I.~Christensen for making my drawings look much better than they deserve.
