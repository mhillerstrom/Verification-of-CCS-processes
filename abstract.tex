The main achievement of this thesis is the construction and (rigorous) verification of an operational based inference system for reasoning about bisimulation equivalence and inequivalence.

The system is implemented in PROLOG and is capable of producing a bisimulation containing a given pair of (CCS-)processes in case they are equivalent. More important, the system is also capable of giving a modal property as {\em an argument for inequivalence\/} in case the processes are not equivalent.
This makes the system very suitable as an automatic tool aiding verification and debugging of systems. The usefulness is demonstrated through several examples.

A notion of {\em extended bisimulation\/} is introduced as a faithful extension of ordinary bisimulation supplying information on how the pairs of a bisimulation actually fit together.

An extended system arguing for extended bisimulation equivalence and inequivalence is constructed and implemented. The extended PROLOG system is demonstrated through some examples.
