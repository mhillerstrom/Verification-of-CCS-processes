# Verification of CCS-processes
####     M.Sc. thesis by Michael Hillerstr√∂m

This repository contains the full source for my thesis work including working
code, examples, and extractor utilities.

The material herein is an author re-type with very few changes from the original.
Only some mis-spellings and missing punctuation marks, corrected indices
etc. Also, all pictures have been redrawn using LaTeX picture environment.

_I did not even correct my (obvious) mistake in the conclusion - can you spot it?_

Enjoy!
