\chapter[PROLOG implementation of new system]{PROLOG implementation of new system\subheading{---arguing for bisimulation equivalence and inequivalence}}\label{appPrologImp}

Listed below is the full PROLOG representation of the new inference system for finding (strong) bisimulations (see figure~\ref{figNewSysInference}), including the definitions of all auxillary predicates. Also, a \verb!help!-predicate has been included as to give on-line assistance of syntax etc. By entering
\begin{verbatim}
   help.
\end{verbatim}
you will be informed of which subjects help is available for and how to retrieve it.

Please notice, that it has been decided not to clobber-up the listing with too much (irrelevant) text, i.e.\@ no explanations are given but to the most unconventional functions/predicates. Instead, predicates has been grouped together in order to improve readability of the listing.
